# semanticforms changelog

## Next version

- Rewrite of CSS, includes the following changes:
  - Fieldset elements now utilize CSS grid to dynamically fill available space before wrapping to the next row.
  - Input clear button is now a button element, allowing interaction via tab.
  - Input clear button avoids overlap with scrollbars on textarea elements.
  - Added multiple utility classes that define how wide inputs will span in the responsive layout.

## 3.2.1

- Fixed a bug that could cause checkboxes and radio buttons to not submit their values to the server properly.
- Updated various dependencies.

## 3.2.0

- Added a reinitialization method to re-scan existing forms. Called with `window.semanticForms.reinitialize(formName)`.
- Altered logic to enhance forms so that it now ignores inputs that have already been enhanced.
- Updated dependencies.

## 3.1.0

- Added dark mode support.
- Deprecated "reset" versions and "no images" versions.
- Added mutation observer that monitors changes to the DOM and will enhance any additional `semanticForms` forms you insert, but the monitoring may not be perfect. If you want to re-scan for new forms to enhance manually, you may still need to call `window.semanticForms()`.
- Fixed a bug that caused DOM events to be duplicated when DOM elements are added dynamically after the first page load.
- Updated dependencies.

## 3.0.8

- Fixed main export on case-sensitive file systems.
- Updated dependencies.

## 3.0.6

- Fixed missing files in npm package.

## 3.0.5

- Added "reset" versions of the CSS files that set `all: unset;` before applying any semantic forms styles to help avoid conflicts with other CSS. There is a performance degradation to using this technique, so you should only use this if absolutely necessary.

## 3.0.4

- Reduced size of select box text.

## 3.0.3
